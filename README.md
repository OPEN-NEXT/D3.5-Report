## Original task description

Task 3.5: Validation of demonstrators

Lead Partner: [FHG](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/)\
Participants: [WMDE](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de), [WIF](https://wikifactory.com/), [SOM](https://sonomotors.com/), [OPT](https://www.opentec.com/), [STY](https://stykka.com/), [XYZC](http://www.xyzcargo.com/), [FIF](http://www.fictionfactory.nl/), [SOD](http://www.sodaq.com/)

The solutions developed in the previous tasks will be checked against interaction with makers in a hackathon
specifically organised for this purpose. The first aim of the event will be to get direct feedback from users
about the functionalities developed in Wikifactory in task 3.2. The second aim will be to get a feedback on the
data model implemented in the Wikidata instance task 3.3 and therewith to nurture the iterative work of WP2
and three on the development of this data model. WMDE provides this task with its expertise in supporting
and building open knowledge communities and in performing user research in workshops. The close ties of
the practice partners in the OSH scene provide the necessary domain knowledge for the hackathon to meet its
targeted public. The 15 SME cases together with their co-development communities participating in both the
piloting and demonstration phases of this project will join the hackathon too as part of the validation process
of the developed demonstrators. A usability testing will be done for both the developed ICT platform and the
usage of the Wikibase instance.

## Who is doing this?

[OPEN_NEXT](https://opennext.eu/) is a collaboration
between 19 industry and academic partners
across Europe.
Funded by the [European Union](https://europa.eu/)'s
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) programme,
this project seeks to enable small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
to work with consumers, makers, and other communities in rethinking
how products are designed and produced.
[Open source hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/)
is a key enabler of this goal
where the design of a physical product is released with the freedoms
for anyone to study, modify, share, and redistribute copies.
These essential freedoms are based on those of [open source software](https://opensource.org/osd),
which is itself derived from [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
where the word free refers to freedom, *not* free-of-charge.
When put in practice,
these freedoms could potentially not only reduce proprietary vendor lock-in,
planned obsolescence, or waste but also stimulate novel –
even disruptive – business models.
The SME partners in OPENNEXT are experimenting
with producing open source hardware and even opening up the development process
to wider community participation.
They produce diverse products ranging from [desks](https://stykka.com/),
[cargo bike modules](http://www.xyzcargo.com/),
to a [digital scientific instrument platform](https://pslab.io/)
(and [more](https://opennext.eu/project-team/#sme)).

The work carried out in this repository is subject to WP3 of OPEN!NEXT
("Supporting production engineering with ICT infrastructure")
and lead by the [department of Information and Process Control
at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en/about-us/organization/virtual-product-creation.html).
