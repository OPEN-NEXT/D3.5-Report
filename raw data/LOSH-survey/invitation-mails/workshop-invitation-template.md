**Subject:** üóø WP3 Judgement Day + O3H | 27.05. ‚Üê you in? :)


Good afternoon {{name}}!

In the past 2 years we've been developing a variety of tools in WP3 to support OSH development ‚Äì essentially to support the work you are doing :)

After all it's now time to validate to which extent these tools are practically useful for you ‚Äì and to identify the blind spots we still need to work on. The development will happen independently and beyond OPEN!NEXT ‚Äì and your input will be the foundation for that.

Another concern that was circulating through my mind, but doesn't fall exactly under my responsibility: Independently from how well OPEN!NEXT has helped SMEs to build up or scale their business, I'd like to give willing SMEs a perspective and provide them with contacts to the OSH community so their work is supported after the project has ended. I'm fully aware that this is a very individual question and I that I cannot solve every problem, but I wanted to give space for that at 2 events: the demonstrator day in June and the "WP3 Judgement Day" in May (or rather the O3H, see below) ‚Üì

We chose May 27th for our "Judgement Day"; our plan looks as follows:

- meet at 15h CEST
- test!
	- 2h Wikifactory
	- 1h Dashboard
	- 1h LOSH
- buffer + free discussion + outro
- at 19.30h CEST ‚Üí join the Open Hardware Happy Hour (O3H), organized by Happy Lab
	- monthly recurring event to connect with OSH folks
	- session topic: open source synthesizer ("open source music")
	- open talks, exchange, make new friends, have some virtual beers

**Please let me know 'til Thursday noon** (May 12th) whether or not you'll join our 'judgement day' to validate the tools (and if you plan to stay for the O3H). I'll send out the calendar invites after that. If you want to come, but the schedule doesn't work for you ‚Üí please let me know, so we can sort out a solutions. If you think there's someone else who'd join, please feel free to forward this mail to that person :)
